This folder contains *OpenJDK* binaries for the supported target platforms.

Launch `init-*.sh` in order to download the *OpenJDK* from [AdoptOpenJDK](https://adoptopenjdk.net/) and [BellSoft](https://www.bell-sw.com/java.html) for the different target platforms. 

The `init-*.sh` scripts create a stripped down *OpenJDK* runtime environment for the different target platforms in the `runtime` folder. These are used in the created application bundles during the build process.
