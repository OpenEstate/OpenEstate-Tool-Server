This folder contains *OpenJDK* binaries for the supported target platforms.

Launch the `init-*.sh` scripts from this folder or the `openjdk-init.sh` script in the `release` directory in order to download *OpenJDK* for the different target platforms. After downloading a Java runtime environment is created in the `runtime` folder.

The created runtime environments are used by the installer scripts (`build-installer-*.sh`) in order to create the application bundles.
